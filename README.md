# Cryptanalysis-Automatic-Tool-SAT
This project targets on accelerating the automatic search of differential and linear characteristics in symmetric-key primitives with Boolean Satisfiability problem (SAT) method.
Tools adopted:
1. Espresso: translate PLA file to CNF format
2. Cryptominisat: SAT solver
3. CaDiCaL: SAT solver
